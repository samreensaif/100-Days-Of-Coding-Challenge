// Question 118: Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
// Explain & TIP: A for loop is a concise way to run a block of code a specific number of times. It's perfect for when you know exactly how many iterations you need.

// Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.
// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.

// Question 120: Use a for...of loop to iterate through an array of your favorite movies and log each one.
// Explain & TIP: The for...of loop is a modern loop introduced in ES6, designed to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more, making it very readable and easy to use.
