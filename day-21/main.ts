// Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

console.log(`\n\t\tDay-21-Coding-Challenge\n\n\t\t Question # 61: Making Enums\n\n`)

enum vehicles {

    car,
    truck,
    motorcycle,
    rickshaw,
    bus
}

console.log(`Vehicle Car: ${vehicles.car}\nVehicle Bus: ${vehicles.bus}`)

// Question 62: Making a Student Template: Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and then fill in this blueprint with an example student.

// Explain & TIP: This blueprint, called an interface, helps ensure all students have the same kind of information, making your code more organized.

// Question 63: Shape Shifter: Write a program that can describe either a circle or a rectangle using a special type alias, including properties unique to each shape.
