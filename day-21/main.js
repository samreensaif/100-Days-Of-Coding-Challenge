// Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.
// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

// Question 62: Making a Student Template: Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and then fill in this blueprint with an example student.
