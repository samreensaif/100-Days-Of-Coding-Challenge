// Question 106: Determine if a given year is a leap year using comparison operators.

// Explain & TIP: A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This rule helps align our calendar years with the Earth's orbital period.

// Question 108: Compare two strings to check if they are identical, ignoring case sensitivity.

// Explain & TIP: To compare strings without considering their case (uppercase/lowercase), you can convert both strings to the same case before comparing.
